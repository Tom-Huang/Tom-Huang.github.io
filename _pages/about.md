I am a final year (4th) PhD student at **University of Freiburg** supervised by **Prof. Wolfram Burgard**. 
I am currently visiting my supervsisor's new lab at Technical University of Nuremberg and doing research on scene representation and vision language action models. 
Previously I obtained my Master's Degree from **Technical University of Munich**, majoring in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence.
During my Master's study, I was lucky to be able to exchange to **ETH, Zurich** for two semesters and do research on visual-lidar fusion for mapping.
Earlier, I got my Bachelor's Degree on Vehicle Engineering from **Jilin University** in China. 
Currently, my research interests lie in scene representation for robot applications (like open-vocabulary mapping, especially in dynamic scenes), vision language action models for robot navigation and manipulation, and 3D-LLM. **I am Open to Positions now!**

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
